Hey there! I'm Richard, and this is my digital space where I share thoughts on technology, development, and the occasional random idea that pops into my head.

## Meet My Mascot ü¶éüçì

You might have noticed the little sugar glider in my header - that's my unofficial logo! Just like Scrat from Ice Age is obsessed with his acorn, my sugar glider is completely fixated on strawberries. It represents my approach to coding: that same single-minded determination and passion for solving problems, even when they seem impossible (or deliciously out of reach).

The strawberry obsession? Well, sometimes the best solutions come from being a little bit obsessed with the things you love! üçì
