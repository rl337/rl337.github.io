I'm excited to introduce **Trouble**, a versatile CLI tool I've developed for
generating static documentation files. This project was born out of the need for
a simple, flexible solution to create and publish documentation via GitHub
Pages, especially for projects that need automated documentation generation.

## 🛠️ What is Trouble?

Trouble is a Python-based CLI tool designed to generate static documentation
files (Markdown or HTML) that can be published via GitHub Pages. It's
particularly useful for projects that need automated documentation generation as
part of their CI/CD pipeline.

## 🎯 Key Features

### Template-Based Generation

Trouble uses Python's `string.Template` for flexible templating, allowing you to
create reusable templates for different types of documentation:

- **Markdown templates** (`.md.template`)
- **HTML templates** (`.html.template`)
- **Variable substitution** using `${variable}` syntax

### JSON-Driven Content

The tool reads page data from a `trouble/data.json` file, where each key
represents a page with associated metadata:

```json
{
  "page_one": {
    "title": "Hello World",
    "content": "This is the first page generated by Trouble.",
    "filename": "page_one.html"
  }
}
```

### GitHub Actions Integration

Trouble is designed to work seamlessly with GitHub Actions, automatically
generating and publishing documentation when changes are merged to the main
branch.

## 🚀 How It Works

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Generate documentation from templates
python -m trouble generate
```

The `generate` command:

1. Reads page data from `trouble/data.json`
2. Processes templates in the `trouble/templates/` directory
3. Outputs generated files to the `docs/` directory
4. Supports both Markdown and HTML output formats

### Template System

Templates use Python's `string.Template` syntax for variable substitution:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>${title}</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>${title}</h1>
    <p>${content}</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The project includes a `.github/workflows/publish.yml` file that defines the
GitHub Action for automated documentation publishing:

```yaml
name: Publish Documentation
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Generate Documentation
        run: python -m trouble generate
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        # ... deployment steps
```

## 🎨 Use Cases

Trouble is perfect for:

- **Project documentation** that needs to be generated from data
- **API documentation** with dynamic content
- **Report generation** from structured data
- **Static site generation** for simple projects
- **Automated documentation** in CI/CD pipelines

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

The tool is built with:

- **Python 3.x** as the core language
- **JSON** for data storage and configuration
- **string.Template** for templating
- **GitHub Actions** for automated deployment
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting

├── trouble/              # Main Python package
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── generate.py       # Core generation logic
│   └── templates/        # Template files

└── .github/workflows/   # CI/CD configuration
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

To use Trouble in your own project:

1. **Install the tool**:

   ```bash
   pip install trouble
   ```

2. **Create your data file**:

   ```json
   {
     "my_page": {
       "title": "My Page",
       "content": "This is my generated page.",
       "filename": "my_page.html"
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Create templates**:

   ```html
   <!-- templates/page.html.template -->
   <h1>${title}</h1>
   <p>${content}</p>
   ```

4. **Generate documentation**:

   ```bash
   python -m trouble generate
   ```

- **Configuration file support** (YAML, TOML)
- **Plugin system** for custom generators
- **Watch mode** for development
- **Advanced templating** features

## 💡 Why Trouble?

The name "Trouble" reflects the tool's purpose - it helps you get out of
trouble when you need quick, automated documentation generation. It's designed
to be simple yet powerful, solving the common problem of maintaining
up-to-date documentation without manual effort.

Trouble represents my approach to building practical tools that solve real
problems. It's not about complexity - it's about providing a clean, simple
solution that just works.
